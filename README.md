This was our team app called Dialect Dictionary.

The problem we found with learning new languages is the many different dialects for a specific language.

Take Spanish for example, Words in the North of Spain can sometimes mean something completely different in the South of Spain. 

Or worse in a different Spanish speaking country.

The app pulls from a Collins-Webster free source for transation of words in english and spanish.

Please have a go!
